"""
harness/noise_injection.py -- a fully public, documented query-drift
stress-test recipe you can run locally (assignment Section 6, "Practice
noise recipe (public)").

perturb_pseudo_relevant_set() takes a clean pseudo-relevant doc_id list
and swaps a stated fraction of it for OTHER documents from the same
candidate pool -- i.e. documents the first-pass retriever also considered
plausible enough to make the top-K, but that didn't make your seed's
top-PRF_DEPTH -- and returns the perturbed list, same length, same
doc_ids still all valid candidates. Drawing noise from within the
candidate pool rather than from the whole corpus is deliberate: it models
"plausible but wrong" contamination (a document that scored reasonably
under the first-pass retriever but isn't actually relevant), which is a
harder and more realistic case for a relevance model to reject than
wildly unrelated noise would be. Use this to test your own
relevance_model_feedback() against contaminated input before you submit.

THIS IS NOT THE GRADING RECIPE. The real Track C noise levels, sampling
strategy, and number of perturbed conditions are undisclosed (assignment
Section 6, "Grading noise recipe (undisclosed)") for exactly the reason
Assignment 1's held-out topics and baseline parameters were undisclosed:
a submission tuned against a known perturbation recipe is measuring its
ability to guess the recipe, not its robustness to realistic drift. Build
a feedback function that is robust across a *range* of noise conditions
and fractions, not one that happens to do well at the specific fractions
below.
