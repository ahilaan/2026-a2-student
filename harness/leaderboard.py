"""
harness/leaderboard.py -- combine raw metrics into the weighted
leaderboard score defined in the assignment (Section 7):

    Track A (base LM accuracy)        30%
  + Track B (clean feedback accuracy) 25%
  + Track C (drift robustness)        35%
  + Bonus (adversarial round-robin)   up to +10%, additive only

As in Assignment 1, every track above is computed relative to the class
(percentile rank), not from raw metric values -- see Assignment 1's
harness/leaderboard.py module docstring, "Why accuracy is class-relative
too", which applies unchanged here: a fixed weight only translates into
that much real influence on rank order if the underlying raw values are
actually spread out across the class, which you cannot guarantee in
advance. A single team running this harness locally cannot compute the
real leaderboard_score in isolation -- course staff assemble it when
aggregating the full class leaderboard (see the instructor-tools
repository's aggregate_leaderboard.py).

Track C is NOT a raw noisy-condition score -- it is a *retention ratio*:
(mean nDCG@10 across the noisy conditions) / (your own clean-condition
nDCG@10, i.e. your Track B raw score), percentile-ranked. See the
assignment, Section 7, "A note on why Track C is a ratio, not a raw
score", for why: scoring raw noisy-condition accuracy alone would just
reward whoever already had the best Track A/B accuracy (correlated
signal, not new information); dividing out your own clean-condition score
isolates how much you specifically lose to noise, independent of how
strong you already were.
