"""
harness/candidates_io.py -- reading the provided top-K candidate list
every submission reranks (assignment Section 6). Deliberately
dependency-free, same conventions as harness/trec_io.py.

Format (candidates_dev.jsonl): one JSON object per line,
    {"qid": "q1", "candidates": [["d18", 12.34], ["d16", 9.87], ...]}
already sorted best-first by whatever first-pass retriever produced them.
The exact retriever and its parameters are NOT disclosed (assignment
Section 6, "Where the provided candidates come from") -- only its output
for the released dev/toy topics is. The held-out set's candidates file is
never released at all; course staff apply the same harness against it
internally at grading time.
