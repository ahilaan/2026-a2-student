"""
submission/corpus_utils.py

Small, shared, non-graded utility for reading the corpus format used
throughout this assignment. You are welcome to use this as-is — reading a
JSONL file is plumbing, not the ranking logic the assignment grades — or
replace it if your index needs a different loading strategy (e.g.
streaming instead of loading everything into memory).
