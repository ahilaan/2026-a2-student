tests/test_interface_conformance.py -- the exact check the CI conformance
job runs on every push (assignment Section 5, "Submission Interface &
Conformance Checking"). If this file passes, your submission has the
right shape for the grading harness to run it; it says nothing about
ranking quality.

Run it yourself any time with:
