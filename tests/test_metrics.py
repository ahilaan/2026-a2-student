"""
tests/test_metrics.py — unit tests for harness/metrics.py itself, with
hand-computable examples. These exist so you can trust the scoring code
(it's the same code that computes your grade) without having to take our
word for it — every expected value below is derived by hand in the
comments, not just asserted against the implementation's own output.
